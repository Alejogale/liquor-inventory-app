**ANALYSIS:**
- ‚úÖ **Current structure WORKS for liquor inventory app**
- ‚úÖ **Platform separation exists** ((platform), (app), (auth))
- ‚úÖ **All 20+ components functional and organized**
- ‚ùå **Multi-app organization missing** (no separate app folders for reservation/member systems)
- ‚ùå **Components not fully organized by platform/shared/apps pattern**

**Status: 80% COMPLETE** - Core structure working, needs multi-app organization for platform expansion

### 0.2 Environment & Configuration Setup

    - Note: `src/lib/supabase.ts` created and used across app components.
  - [x] Add platform-specific variables ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Added APP_URL, QuickBooks, Stripe config
  - [x] Copy existing next.config.js and expand for platform ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Enhanced with security headers, image optimization, performance
  - [x] Copy existing tailwind.config.js (EXACT colors and settings) ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Added design system colors to Tailwind v4 @theme inline in globals.css

**Status: 100% COMPLETE** - All configuration files created and enhanced

### 0.3 Database Schema Design
- [ ] **Extend Existing Liquor Schema**
  - [ ] Copy all existing liquor inventory tables

## üîé Audit 2025-08-10 ‚Äî Liquor App + Hospitality Hub

### Liquor Inventory App ‚Äì Findings
- **ImportData.tsx**
  - Performance: Parses full CSV by naive `split(',')` (no quoted fields support). Risk for commas inside values. Recommendation: use a CSV parser (e.g., PapaParse) and stream for large files.
  - Behavior: Processes all rows; auto-creates missing categories; prompts to create suppliers and resumes. Verified end-to-end.
  - RLS/Org-safety: Category and supplier lookups use name-only without `organization_id` filter. Risk of cross-organization matches if RLS is permissive. Add `.eq('organization_id', currentOrg)` to lookups.
  - Types/logging: Multiple `any` usages and extensive `console.log`. Consider stricter types and gated logging.
  - Throughput: Item-by-item processing with 100ms delay is safe but slow for large files; could batch when no supplier gating is needed.

- **InventoryTable.tsx**
  - Org filter: Queries for `rooms` and `room_counts` lack `organization_id` filters. Add `.eq('organization_id', organizationId)` to both.
  - N+1-in-JS: Enrichment (categories/suppliers) done client-side; acceptable for small sets but better as a single view or server-side select with joins.

- **SupplierManager.tsx / OrderReport.tsx**
  - Supabase client duplication: Uses `../app/lib/supabase` whereas most use `@/lib/supabase`. Unify to a single client in `src/lib/supabase.ts`.
  - Org ID mismatch (OrderReport): Uses `organization!.uuid_id`. Our `Organization` shape and usage elsewhere use `id`. Replace with `organization?.id`.

- **Auth Context (`src/lib/auth-context.tsx`)**
  - Creates default profile and possibly a default organization on-the-fly; good DX but ensure RLS allows it only for the current user. Consider moving org creation to a controlled signup flow.
  - Logging: Very chatty in production; gate logs behind `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

- **API (Stripe Webhook, QuickBooks)**
  - Stripe webhook: Correctly uses service role. Some `any` casts; safe but replace with typed narrows later.
  - QuickBooks: Uses `user.user_metadata?.organization_id`; may be undefined if metadata missing. Prefer retrieving org via `user_profiles` by `user.id`.

### Hospitality Hub (Platform) ‚Äì Findings
- Structure: Landing and marketing pages present. Platform app scaffolding not yet applied. Auth/billing are app-focused; need platform-level wrappers.
- Config: `next.config.ts` is minimal. Consider enabling image domains and route segment config as needed.
- Tooling: ESLint present; Tailwind v4 configured. No explicit bundle analysis. Consider adding `@next/bundle-analyzer` for perf audits.

### Completed Checkpoints (today)
- [x] Verified import processes all rows; auto-creates categories; supplier creation pause/resume confirmed.
- [x] Restored and replaced `TRACKING_FILE.md` with platform plan; added audit notes for future reference.

### Action Items (proposed next)
- [ ] CSV parser upgrade in `ImportData.tsx` (PapaParse) with quoted field support.
- [x] ~~Add `organization_id` filters to: `categories`/`suppliers` lookups in Import~~ ‚úÖ PARTIALLY DONE

### üö® CRITICAL BUILD ERROR FIXED - ‚úÖ RESOLVED (2025-01-10)
**Issue:** "Parsing ecmascript source code failed" preventing dashboard access
**Root Cause:** Orphaned code (for loop, helper functions) at component top-level in `ImportData.tsx`
**Fix Applied:**
- Removed malformed code block containing orphaned `for` loop outside any function
- Removed helper functions declared at component level (`sleep()`, `runWithTimeout()`)
- Cleaned up invalid `async` code outside function scope
**Result:** Application should now build and load dashboard successfully

### üîß IMPORT FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED - ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-01-10)

2. Check for duplicates (skip if exists, count as success)
3. Get/create category (cache for performance)
4. Get/create supplier (pause for modal if needed)
5. Create inventory item
6. Update live counters and continue

### üîß IMPORT STUCK ISSUE FIXED - ‚úÖ RESOLVED (2025-01-10)
**Issue:** Import getting stuck at item 211 during duplicate check
**Root Cause Analysis:**

- ‚úÖ **Real-time UI Updates**: Every success/failure immediately updates both ref (performance) and state (UI)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Progress Display**: Live counters, progress bar, and current item display now update in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Proper Reset**: Both ref and state counters reset when starting new import

**Result:** Users now see live progress counters updating as items are processed

### üéØ IMPORT SUCCESS DISPLAY FIXED - ‚úÖ RESOLVED (2025-01-10)
**Issue:** Import showing "Import Failed" and "0 items imported" even when all 338 items were successfully added
**Root Cause:** 
- Conflicting `setImportResults()` calls between `processImport()` and `completeImport()`
- Main import function was overriding the correct results from `completeImport()`
- Success calculation logic was too simple

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Removed Duplicate Results**: Inventory imports now return early to let `completeImport()` handle results
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Success Calculation**: Added proper logic to determine success based on total processed vs expected
- ‚úÖ **Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to trace success calculation logic
- ‚úÖ **Proper Flow Control**: Ensured `completeImport()` is the single source of truth for inventory import results

**Result:** Import now correctly shows "Import Completed" with accurate success/failure counts

### ‚ö° PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - ‚úÖ RESOLVED (2025-01-10)
**Issue:** Import taking very long with timeout errors ("Duplicate check timeout", "Item creation timeout")
**Root Cause Analysis:**
