# Blog Visual Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Gradient Visibility Issues**
**Problem**: The gradients were too subtle and not visible enough
**Solution**: 
- Changed main background from `from-orange-50 via-white to-red-50` to `from-orange-100 via-orange-50 to-red-100`
- Increased header gradient opacity from `/5` to `/10` for better visibility
- Enhanced "Coming Soon" section gradient opacity from `/5` to `/10`

### 2. **Blog Card Spacing Issues**
**Problem**: Blog cards were too close to the borders with insufficient padding
**Solution**:
- Increased card padding from `p-8` to `p-10` for better breathing room
- This provides more space between content and card edges
- Creates better visual balance and readability

## Specific Changes Made

### **Background Gradients**
- **Before**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-50 via-white to-red-50`
- **After**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-100 via-orange-50 to-red-100`
- **Result**: More visible orange-to-red gradient that's easier to see

### **Header Gradients**
- **Before**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500/5 to-red-500/5`
- **After**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500/10 to-red-500/10`
- **Result**: More prominent gradient overlay in header sections

### **Card Padding**
- **Before**: `p-8` (32px padding)
- **After**: `p-10` (40px padding)
- **Result**: Better spacing between content and card borders
