-- =====================================================
-- FIX 1: Temporarily make RLS policies more permissive for testing
-- =====================================================

-- Drop the current restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "categories_read_access" ON categories;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "suppliers_read_access" ON suppliers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "inventory_items_read_access" ON inventory_items;

-- Create very permissive SELECT policies for authenticated users

    USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "suppliers_temp_access" ON suppliers
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "inventory_items_temp_access" ON inventory_items
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Test the fix
