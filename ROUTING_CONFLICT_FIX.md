# 🔧 Routing Conflict Fix

```
Error: You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. 
Please check /(platform)/about and /about.
```

1. **Deleted:** `src/app/(platform)/about/page.tsx`
2. **Deleted:** `src/app/(platform)/about/layout.tsx`
3. **Kept:** `src/app/about/page.tsx` (new personal about page)

### **✅ Result:**
- **About Page:** ✅ Working (HTTP 200)
- **Privacy Page:** ✅ Working (HTTP 200)
- **Terms Page:** ✅ Working (HTTP 200)
- **No Conflicts:** All pages accessible at their intended URLs
