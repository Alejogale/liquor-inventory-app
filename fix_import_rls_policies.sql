-- VERIFY POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Check all policies after the fix
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('categories', 'suppliers', 'inventory_items')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Test queries to make sure RLS is working
SELECT 'categories' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM categories
UNION ALL
SELECT 'suppliers', COUNT(*) FROM suppliers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'inventory_items', COUNT(*) FROM inventory_items;

-- Success message
SELECT 'Import RLS policies fixed successfully! Categories, suppliers, and inventory_items should now work for imports.' as status;
